## How I run Tauri: 
### Webstorm
Run React with `npm start`
For Windows 10 you open a terminal and go to the top level directory of the poker-trainer application. Once you are there you run the command `npm run tauri dev`

### For VS Code:
You have multiple ways to run React and Rust using VS Code:
1. VS Code supports multiple debug console with `launch.json` 
2. You can run the code manually (I would recommend this option)

To run React you run the command `npm start`
To run Tauri you run the command `npm run tauri dev`

## Final Result of running Tauri:
If this is done correctly you should have a small application on your taskbar with Tauri running (not through a web browser)
